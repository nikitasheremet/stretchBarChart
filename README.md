# stretchBarChart
Bar Chart Stretch project

## About
The goal of this project was to build an API , *drawBarChart()*, that could be used to quickly build a simple bar/stacked bar chart in a webpage. 

When building your webpage in order to use the API you would need to downlod the files **chartJs.js** and
**jQuery.js** from the Repo and link your *index.html* file to them.




The API would recieve 3 parameters :
- Data
- Graph Options
- Element Name
